### Setting Up GitHub and Continuous Deployment for Your Malama Labs Project

I'll guide you through the process of getting your code on GitHub and setting up continuous deployment with Vercel, so you can easily make changes from v0.dev and have them automatically deployed.

## 1. Create a GitHub Repository

First, you need to create a repository on GitHub:

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in (or create an account if you don't have one)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "malama-labs-certification-tool")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Click "Create repository"


## 2. Initialize Your Local Repository and Push to GitHub

Now, you need to initialize a Git repository in your project folder and push it to GitHub:

```shellscript
...
```

## 3. Deploy to Vercel

Now, let's deploy your project to Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click "Add New..." and select "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure your project:

1. Framework Preset: Next.js
2. Root Directory: ./
3. Build Command: next build
4. Output Directory: .next



5. Add your environment variables:

1. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
2. NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY



6. Click "Deploy"


## 4. Set Up Continuous Deployment

Vercel automatically sets up continuous deployment when you connect your GitHub repository. Every time you push changes to your main branch, Vercel will automatically rebuild and redeploy your application.

## 5. Using v0.dev with Your Project

To work on your project using v0.dev and have changes automatically deployed:

1. **Create a v0.dev Workspace**:

1. Go to v0.dev and sign in with your Vercel account
2. Create a new workspace or use an existing one
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository



2. **Add Code from v0.dev to Your Project**:

1. When you create components in v0.dev, click the "..." menu in the top right of the block
2. Select "Add to codebase"
3. Choose your GitHub repository and the appropriate location in your project
4. Add a commit message
5. Click "Commit changes"



3. **Alternative Method - Manual Copy**:

1. Copy the code from v0.dev
2. Create or edit the appropriate file in your GitHub repository directly through the GitHub web interface
3. Commit the changes





## 6. Preview Deployments

Vercel also creates preview deployments for pull requests:

1. Create a new branch in your GitHub repository
2. Make changes and create a pull request
3. Vercel will automatically create a preview deployment for your pull request
4. Review the changes in the preview deployment
5. Merge the pull request when you're satisfied


## 7. Setting Up GitHub Actions (Optional)

For more advanced CI/CD workflows, you can set up GitHub Actions:

```yaml file=".github/workflows/ci.yml"
...
```

## 8. Accessing Your Code from v0.dev

To access your existing code from v0.dev:

1. Sign in to v0.dev with the same Vercel account connected to your GitHub repository
2. Create a new workspace or use an existing one
3. Connect it to your GitHub repository
4. You can now browse your code and make changes directly from v0.dev


## 9. Managing Environment Variables

Make sure your environment variables are properly set up in both your local development environment and on Vercel:

1. Create a `.env.local` file for local development (don't commit this to GitHub)
2. Add your environment variables to Vercel through the Vercel dashboard
3. If you're using GitHub Actions, add the environment variables as GitHub Secrets


By following these steps, you'll have a fully automated workflow where you can make changes to your code from v0.dev or directly on GitHub, and have those changes automatically deployed to your Vercel application.
